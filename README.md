What is Crypto Currently?
Our mission at Crypto Currently is to simplify the process for new investors to dive into the world of Crypto currency investment.
API’s Coin Gecko, Currents (News API).
CSS Library Used: Foundation.

Landing Page
This page allows the users to view the latest news about crypto coins. There is a ticker below the nav bar that allows user to track current crypto prices. On the side, we have attached some video resources for users to watch and finally you can find links to the assessment form or a link directly to a third-party site to begin signing up and purchasing crypto coins.

Assessment Form
Interacting with the user to get their requirements in order to call to the API to render results.
When the user is on this page, we present them with 3 questions to narrow down their information overload. These questions were created to call on the DOM to fetch and display results. We determined the basis of coins based on price per coin and used its historical data to determine its stability as a long term or short-term investment.

Results
Appending results to the Document Object Model (DOM).
When the user reaches this page, they can see the appended results that our two APIs appended. Furthermore, they can now take their crypto knowledge and choice of coin and compare the fees associated to buying and selling crypto coins on various platforms using our calculator.
